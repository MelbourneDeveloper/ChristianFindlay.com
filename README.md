# ChristianFindlay.com

This is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and HTML/CSS source code for my personal website, [ChristianFindlay.com](http://christianfindlay.com/). I created this from the [snowlake](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/snowlake-website-jekyll-theme) theme. I open-sourced this website so the community can contribute to blog posts by making suggestions to fix factual inaccuracies or to add additional information. If you are a web developer with a keen eye for aesthetics, you are also welcome to submit PRs for visual fixes, but please talk to me before jumping into changes.
