# ChristianFindlay.com

This is the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and HTML/CSS source code for my personal website, [ChristianFindlay.com](http://christianfindlay.com/). I created this from the [snowlake](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/snowlake-website-jekyll-theme) theme. I open-sourced this website so the community can contribute to blog posts by making suggestions to fix factual inaccuracies or to add additional information. If you are a web developer with a keen eye for aesthetics, you are also welcome to submit PRs for visual fixes, but please talk to me before jumping into changes.

## Hire Me

I build Flutter and .NET apps. Contact me through [Twitter](https://twitter.com/CFDevelop), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-findlay/) or the [contact form](https://www.christianfindlay.com/contact) on my website.

## Blog Posts

Blog posts are in markdown format. Feel free to submit PRs to fix factual inaccuracies or to add additional information. You can find them in the [`_posts`](site/_posts) directory.

## Run/Test Website Locally

You need to install Jekyll which runs on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

Follow the instructions for installing Jekyll [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/). 

Once everything is installed, you can run the website locally by running the following command in the `site` directory of the project:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
