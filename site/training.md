# Online Training

I provide online training for Flutter and Dart. In particular, I teach [Flutter Widget Testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction), a very important skill for any Flutter developer. I also teach people how to build Flutter apps with [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt). This allows people new to programming to build apps with no prior experience. The online format with Zoom and Visual Studio Code Live Share makes it easy to learn from anywhere worldwide while collaborating in a safe and supportive environment.

## Flutter Widget Testing
Flutter Widget Testing is an essential aspect of the app development process that focuses on ensuring the app works. It is a form of automated testing. By validating the expected behavior of actual use cases, developers can easily identify and resolve issues before release, leading to a more reliable and robust final product. Ultimately, widget testing makes it easier for teams to collaborate and adapt to evolving project requirements. Flutter developers need to learn widget testing to improve their code's reliability and reduce the time spent on fixing bugs.

## The Process

#### What Students Learn
Students learn the essential techniques and best practices for effectively testing an entire application from the root widget. This holistic approach includes the complete app structure, encompassing all widgets and their composition. Throughout the training, students will gain valuable insights into designing and implementing rigorous test cases that cover various scenarios. By mastering full app Flutter Widget Testing, students learn the skills to develop high-quality, reliable, scalable applications that stand out in the competitive app market.

Subsequent sessions will take the same approach but cover more advanced topics like [running widget tests as integration tests](https://www.christianfindlay.com/blog/flutter-integration-tests) on devices for the highest level of app confidence.

Specifically, the sessions will cover
- Refactoring for dependency injection
- Mocking with [Mockito](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito)
- Flutter's testing framework ([expect](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/expect.html), [verify](https://pub.dev/documentation/mockito/latest/mockito/verify.html))
- Flutter [widget testing](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/WidgetTester-class.html) framework
- Advanced sessions will include [goldens](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/flutter_test/matchesGoldenFile.html) and [integration testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/integration/introduction)

#### Book a Session
Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-findlay), and we can find a time that matches your timezone.

#### Prerequisites
- Some knowledge of Flutter
- Zoom
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share)

#### Recommended Reading
- [Full App Widget Testing](/blog/flutter_full_app_widget_testing)
- [An introduction to widget testing](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook/testing/widget/introduction)
- [Testing Flutter apps](https://docs.flutter.dev/testing)

#### The Session
The session has two parts. Firstly, I explain the concepts and techniques with slides. The second part is a hands-on session where I guide the students through writing, refactoring the app for testing, and then adding tests to the sample app. We can record the session.

#### Cost
**Basic session (two hours)**: USD 350 for up to four people and an additional $80 per person for each participant beyond the first four. We can make alterations to the session to suit your team's needs.
