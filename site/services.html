      <h2 class="section-title text-uppercase mb-20">Build An App</h2>

      <p>
        Are you tired of building multiple apps for different platforms and struggling to maintain them? Let me take
        care of it
        for you. As a skilled Flutter app developer, I can create a single-source, cross-platform app that runs
        seamlessly on
        phones, desktops, and in the browser without compromising quality or performance.</p>

        <p>I have years of experience building scalable systems with .NET, relational and Document databases. I can build all the aspects of your system.</p>

      <p>I'll work with you to understand your unique needs and design an app that aligns with your vision. I prioritize
        testing
        and guarantee high automated test coverage to ensure that your app meets your users' expectations.</p>

      <p>You'll own the code, allowing you to evaluate other options and switch to another developer anytime. My
        services have no
        lock-in, so you can rest assured that you're making the best decision for your business.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title text-uppercase mb-20">Design</h2>


      <p>Bring your own design, or engage with my network to design a beautiful app. I work with designers who can get
        the ball
        rolling quickly or polish what you already have. Walk away with designs in Figma that I can translate into an
        app you
        can deploy to the stores. I usually work within Google's Material Design paradigm.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title text-uppercase mb-20">Evaluate Your App for Best Practice</h2>


      <p>Is your app following industry best practices and delivering the best user experience possible? Let me help you
        find out. As an experienced app developer, I specialize in evaluating codebases and ensuring apps meet the
        highest
        standards.‚Äç</p>

      <p>With a comprehensive <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/a4bc27cb3302c4c5c2497d5cd00604a2">checklist</a> and a focus
        on automated testing, I can identify areas of improvement and help you
        and your team build tests to ensure your app follows best practices. By facilitating refactoring, you can be
        confident
        that your app is optimized for performance and user satisfaction.</p>

      <p>I can quickly provide clarity about your codebase in just a day or two. Let's work together to take your app to
        the next level and ensure it delivers the best possible experience for your users.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title text-uppercase mb-20">Widget Testing Training</h2>
