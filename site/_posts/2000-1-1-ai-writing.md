AI has recently become capable of producing high-quality written content. While some people dispute how well AI can write, it's undeniable that it affects the way content gets created. I want to make it clear that, from now on, I will utilise AI to generate content, provide fact checks, conduct research, and edit content. However, the quality of this website will not diminish. Actually, it's going to get better.

## Why AI-Generated Content?
This is a small blog, and I don't have unlimited time to deliver content. However, I want to deliver content that is of the same quality as prior to AI or better, and I want to deliver more of it. AI allows me to do this. [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) alone does not produce well-written content, but a combination of [Claude AI Research](https://www.anthropic.com/news/research) and [OpenAI Deep Research](https://openai.com/index/introducing-deep-research/) with AI agents like Claude Code produces amazing content that draws on extensive sources.

## Google's AI Summaries Impacted My Traffic

Recently, my monthly statistics took a pounding. It wasn't quite clear why this happened. At first, I thought it was because of changes to Google's algorithm, but then I learned that [Google's AI summaries caused a devastating drop](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/24/ai-summaries-causing-devastating-drop-in-online-news-audiences-study-finds) in many websites.

It turns out that [AI-generated content does not hurt Google rankings](https://ahrefs.com/blog/ai-generated-content-does-not-hurt-your-google-rankings/), but I cannot justify spending the amount of time I was spending on writing content when the returns are diminishing.

## My Commitment
I am committed to posting informative, original and accurate content on this website. I will meticulously review all content, edit it for readability and accuracy, and ensure the same high level of quality that this website has always maintained. 

So far, what I'm seeing is that AI research tools greatly enhance my ability to provide accurate background information, ensure links are correct and provide plenty of further reading.

## Content Changes
The content on this website is changing. I will post more long-form articles, with a greater emphasis on research and a reduced emphasis on tutorials. This isn't because AI creates a firehose of cheap content for this purpose. This is because this is the kind of content that I have always wanted to post on this blog, but it was too time-consuming without AI. Moreover, AI makes code samples trivial, and few people click through to my tutorials just for the purpose of seeing tutorials that AI can often write for them.

As always, please report issues on the [issues section](https://github.com/MelbourneDeveloper/ChristianFindlay.com/issues) to improve article quality.
