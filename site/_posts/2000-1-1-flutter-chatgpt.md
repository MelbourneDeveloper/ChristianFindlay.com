## Introduction

Building your own mobile app might seem like a daunting task, especially if you're not a tech-savvy person. However, with tools like Flutter and the guidance of AI-powered assistants like ChatGPT, it's more accessible than ever. This beginner-friendly guide will take you through the steps of creating a basic Flutter app with the help of ChatGPT, even if you have little to no technical background.

## What is Flutter?

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. Use it to build beautiful apps for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. You can create an app that runs smoothly on both iOS and Android without creating two separate apps. And, use the same code to run on Windows, Mac, and in the browser. It's a guaranteed time saver for your business, and with the the popularity of Flutter steadily growing, you can be sure that your business can depend on Flutter for the long run.

### Flutter Basics - Dart Language 
Flutter uses Dart programming language. It's easy to learn and resembles Java or C#, but you don't need to know Dart to get ChatGPT to build your first app.

### Flutter Basics - Widgets
Widgets are the building blocks of your app's UI. All the items onscreen are widgets and your organize them into a tree. Read more about the basic widgets [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/widgets/basics).

## What is ChatGPT?

[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) is a Large Language Model (LLM / AI-driven chatbot) developed by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). It can assist with various tasks, including coding. ChatGPT can help you understand Flutter concepts, troubleshoot issues, and even write snippets of code.

## Prerequisites

- You can use a local installation of Flutter or [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/?id=e75b493dae1287757c5e1d77a0dc73f1). 
- You need ChatGPT. For full functionality like image processing, you need to sign up for a ChatGPT account, but you can use the basic model for free

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

Before you build an app, you either need to set up the Flutter development environment on your computer, or you can use [Dartpad](https://dartpad.dev/?id=e75b493dae1287757c5e1d77a0dc73f1), which allows you to create a Flutter app in the browser directly. Dartpad might be easier if you've never installed a development environment before. If you use Dartpad, you can skip the installation step.

### Installing Flutter
Visit the [official Flutter website](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and follow the instructions to download and install Flutter on your system. 

### Installing an Editor (IDE)
You'll need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Android Studio or Visual Studio Code. Both are user-friendly and offer great support for Flutter development. You can follow the instructions [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/editor), which are also on the official Flutter website.


## Step 2: Create the Project

Follow the instructions in this [codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-codelab-first#0) to create your first Flutter project. You don't need to follow the tutorial all the way through. You can just step through until you have a running app, which is an early step in this tutorial. When you press play, the app should eventually start, and look like this:

## Step 3: Design Your App

The easiest way to get started is to draw your app as a wireframe with a tool like [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) or [Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/). Figma is a full-fledged design tool and it's great because developers understand how to use it. However, Draw IO is free to use and allows you to build wireframes quickly. This is what it looks like. I created this with a wireframe template.

You could even draw the image by with a tablet, or scan it. ChatGPT will understand the general gist.

## Step 4: ChatGPT Writes the App

Choose ChatGPT 4 if you have the full version of ChatGPT, and click the button here to feed ChatGPT your design. If you don't have the paid version of ChatGPT, you may need to explain the design with words.

The next important step is prompting ChatGPT. This is the secret sauce. Practicing your prompt engineering is the real key to getting the most from ChatGPT. My app [Context Note](https://www.contextnote.com/) helps you take control of prompting ChatGPT and helps you to build apps with a better user interface than the standard ChatGPT screen.

ChatGPT will think about your request and output something like this

It should give you some Flutter code and it will look something like this:

Copy the code and paste it over the top of the code in `main.dart` from step 2. You can paste it into Dartpad if you didn't install an IDE.

## FAQs

- Do I need programming experience to use Flutter?

No, basic concepts are straightforward, and resources like ChatGPT can help beginners.

- Is Flutter free to use?

Yes, Flutter is an open-source framework and is completely free.

- Can ChatGPT write my entire app?

Yes, but it may require many iterations, and eventually you will probably hit a point where you need an experienced Flutter developer to maintain the finished product. Reach out to me [here](/#contact).
