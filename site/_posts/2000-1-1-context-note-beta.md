AI is the biggest leap in computing technology since the internet gained popularity in the 90s, and I have a passion for improving the user experience of working with it. ChatGPT recently took the world by storm and it has increased productivity for writers and programmers alike. 

However, I noticed that the tooling around ChatGPT, and other LLMs is lacking. The tools don't give you full control of the AI's working memory, which is critical for getting the most out of an LLM. 

That's why I created [Context Note](https://www.contextnote.com/), a text and code editing app that allows you to control the conversation history (context) with ChatGPT, or any other LLM. 

## What is Context?
