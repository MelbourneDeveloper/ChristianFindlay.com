For most people, the COVID-19 pandemic was a harrowing experience that forced them to change their lives in ways they never imagined. For some, it was a blessing in disguise. They were able to work from home spend more time with their family, and find a better work-life balance. Those that could work from home, did so, and the general consensus was that remote work produced as much productivity as office work, if not more (citation). But, businesses are now encouraging or forcing their employees to go back to the office. Why? 

## Is Remote Work Less Productive?

The experts say no. In fact, experts say that remote work is more productive. [citation]

## Why Are Businesses Forcing Employees Back to the Office?

At first glance, it seems like a no-brainer. If remote work is more productive, businesses should embrace it, right? Businesses can save money on office space, gain access to talent in areas outside their immediate vicinity and employees can save money on commuting. It seems like a win-win situation.

So, why are businesses pushing in a direction that seems to defy common sense? The answer to this question is not simple. There are many factors at play. Some employers obviously favor people working in the office. (elon musk citation). But, there is another very large pressure at play. 

Urban life completely changed during the pandemic lockdowns. People stopped commuting to city centres and started working from home. This had a huge impact on the economy of city centres. Restaurants, cafes, and other businesses that relied on office workers for their income were hit hard. (citation). Most importantly, the lockdowns directly took money from the pockets of the city councils. 

## Cities Hit Hard By Lockdowns


    Loss of income from commercial activities. City councils often generate revenue from commercial activities such as parking fees, leisure center admissions, and event permits. These activities were severely disrupted by COVID lockdowns, leading to significant losses in revenue. For example, the City of London estimates that it lost £300 million in revenue from parking fees and other commercial activities during the first lockdown.

    Increased demand for social services. COVID lockdowns also led to an increased demand for social services such as adult social care and homelessness prevention. This increased demand put a strain on city council budgets, as they had to spend more money on these services without receiving any additional revenue. For example, the London Borough of Camden estimates that it spent an additional £10 million on social care during the first lockdown.
    
    Reduction in council tax payments. Council tax is a local property tax that is paid by households in most countries. Council tax payments fell during the COVID pandemic, as many households were struggling financially. For example, the Local Government Association in England estimates that council tax receipts fell by £1.3 billion in 2020-21.


Cities gain revenue through various means such as parking fees, tolls, and other fees. During the lockdowns, these revenue streams dried up.

City councils around the world are now desperate to get people back into the office. They are pressuring businesses to get their employees back into the office.
