The ability to visualize information effectively is more important than ever. Whether you're a developer, a data analyst, or a business owner, presenting data clearly and engagingly can unlock insights and drive better decisions. That's why we're excited to introduce [nimble_charts](https://pub.dev/packages/nimble_charts), a revitalized charting library (charts_flutter) for Flutter that's set to transform your web dashboards. It gives you everything you need to build a Flutter web dashboard with WASM support.

## The Return of a Classic

[charts_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/charts_flutter) was a go-to library for many developers looking to integrate charts into their Flutter apps. However, the Google team responsible for this package decided to discontinue work at the beginning of 2023.

<div style="text-align: center;align-items: center;margin-top: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;"><img height="260px" src="/assets/images/blog/nimble_charts/original.png" alt="charts_flutter"  /></div>

Enter nimble_charts, a fork of the beloved charts_flutter, now maintained by the team at Nimblesite. We've taken the solid foundation of the original library, turned up the dial on type safety, and added a tonne of golden tests to ensure its long-term stability.

## Why Choose Nimble Charts for Your Projects? 
charts_flutter was always a winner because of the flexibility, number of chart types, interactive, responsive visualizations, high-level customization, and extensibility. These unique features make it the ideal choice for your data visualization needs. nimble_charts stands out because of the focus on reliability through thorough automated testing. We want to make nimble_charts the go-to package for charts in Flutter, and we plan to do this by making it the most robust Flutter charting package.

The sample app speaks for itself.

Use it online [here](https://nimblesite.github.io/nimble_charts/).

### Easy To Use
Integrating Nimble Charts into your Flutter projects is a breeze. You can have stunning charts up and running in no time, making it a user-friendly choice for developers.

### Interactive and Responsive Visualizations
Engage your users with charts that aren't just static images. nimble_charts supports interactivity, allowing users to hover, click, and explore data points for deeper insights. This feature will surely excite data analysts, as it opens up new possibilities for data exploration.

### WebAssembly (WASM) Support
Leverage the power of [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) to deliver high-performance web dashboards. Our charts run smoothly in the browser, providing a native-like experience that's both fast and efficient. Flutter recently added [WASM support](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/wasm), and the live sample is made with WASM.

Use it online [here](https://nimblesite.github.io/nimble_charts/).

### Customizable and Extensible
Every project is unique, and nimble_charts offers the flexibility to customize your charts to match your application's look and feel. From colors and fonts to animations and behaviors, make your data visualizations truly your own.

### Actively Maintained
nimble_charts benefits from active maintenance. We're committed to keeping the library up-to-date alongside the Flutter ecosystem. We will prioritize bug fixes, code quality, and testing over new features, but once we're happy with the level of stability, we will look at adding new features again.

### See Nimble Charts in Action
Explore our [live demo](https://nimblesite.github.io/nimble_charts/) built with WebAssembly to experience the capabilities of Nimble Charts firsthand. Witness how fluid and responsive your data visualizations can be on the web. 

You can select a deselect tags to see the different chart types.

### A Nod From The Flutter Community
The revival of this charting library hasn't gone unnoticed. We've already had several [pull requests](https://github.com/Nimblesite/nimble_charts/pull/17) for the library and one influential member of the Flutter community said:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you for bringing back charts!</p>&mdash; Seth Ladd (@sethladd) <a href="https://twitter.com/sethladd/status/1837493581117882672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> 

This sentiment echoes the excitement and appreciation we've received from developers eager to have a reliable charting solution.

## Building Stunning Web Dashboards
Flutter is the right choice for building web dashboards. Flutter is a great UI toolkit for creating stunning apps, but the addition of WASM support introduces a new level of performance and web-readiness. 

<div style="text-align: center;align-items: center;margin-top: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;"><img height="320px" src="/assets/images/blog/nimble_charts/webdashboard.png" alt="Flutter Web Dashboard"  /></div>

Data visualization is more than just displaying numbersâ€”it's about telling a story. With nimble_charts, you can craft dashboards that not only look impressive but also convey meaningful insights. Whether you're tracking user engagement, monitoring real-time analytics, or presenting quarterly reports, our library provides the tools to make your data shine.

### Use Cases

**Business Intelligence Dashboards**: Keep stakeholders informed with up-to-date metrics.

**Financial Reporting**: Visualize trends, forecasts, and performance indicators.
