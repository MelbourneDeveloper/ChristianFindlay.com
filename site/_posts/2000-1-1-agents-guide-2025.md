The AI coding agents market has exploded to **$5.4 billion in 2024** and is projected to reach **$50.31 billion by 2030** ([Grand View Research](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/)), with 76% of developers now using or planning to use AI coding assistants ([Builder.io](https://www.builder.io/)). This guide provides comprehensive, current information on all major AI coding tools with verified pricing, features, and real user experiences.

## Standalone AI-Powered IDEs

These are complete development environments built from the ground up with AI integration at their core, offering the most seamless AI coding experience but requiring you to switch from your current IDE.

The AI coding landscape in 2025 offers mature options for every need and budget. Success depends on choosing the right tool for your use case and implementing proper validation and security practices. The most successful developers will be those who view these tools as assistants rather than replacements for human judgment and expertise ([Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)).
